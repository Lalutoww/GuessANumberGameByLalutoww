# GuessANumberGameByLalutoww
This is a project from SoftUni Fundamentals module. It is a game in which the computer chooses a random number between "1 and 100" and your task is to guess this number.

The program is simple: The computer thinks of a number and gets user input (using node:readline module). If the number is the same as the one the computer chose then the game congratulates you and ends. If the number you typed is higher than the target num it says "Higher!" and the other way around.
